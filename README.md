# Web App for Order Management App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Challange's Description

You are challanged to develop a software for our kitchen staff so they can manage the incoming orders via software instead of paper tickets. In this challange, youâ€™ll develop a small web application. In this application it should be possible to change the status of the order and show relevant information to the chef.

## Task

- Plan how the UI should look like for the chef

- Design it (No need to be super pretty, usability is the key here)

- Implement it

## Solution's Feature

- Chef can sort orders by order's status: Waiting, Ready, Being Prepared, pause

- Chef can update order status

- An order can only be ready if all items are prepared

- Orders are stored in useContext, updating orders is also updating orders in context

## Solution's Techs

- React

- TypeScript

- Material UI

## How to run

- npm install

- npm start

## Estimate Work Time

- Around 10-12 hours including designing, implimenting
